# Highlights of Week of July 26
[Dynamic social networks promote cooperation in experiments with humans](https://www.pnas.org/content/108/48/19193)

In static graphs, high mutation rate can impede the ability of cooperative clusters to persist in a cooperate/defect regime. Inducing network fluidity by allowing agents to use decision histories to form and break ties on a dyadic basis allows for cooperative clusters to persist in time despite mutation pressures; agents punish defection by breaking ties and reward cooperation by preferentially initiating ties with cooperators.

[Intermediate Levels of Network Fluidity Amplify Economic Growth and Mitigate Economic Inequality in Experimental Social Networks](https://sociologicalscience.com/articles-v2-26-544/)

An intermediate $r$ (network fluidity) induces high levels of cooperation, thus increasing average wealth and decreasing the gini coefficient (C-C benefits both ends of the dyad by the same amount). Intuitively, this is because when edges are rarely subject to reevaluation, the threat of punishment via edge destruction is not credible, and when they are constantly subject, the promise of long-term collaboration is not credible.
