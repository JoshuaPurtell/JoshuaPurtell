### Summary

In this experiment, agents are assigned to nodes in an [[Erdos Renyi Graph]] $G(n,\frac{n(n-1)}{10})$, which is rewired with rate $r$. When an edge is subject to rewiring, one of the nodal agents is allowed to unilaterally decide to either create the edge (if it does not exist), destroy the edge (if it does), or do nothing; $rn$ edges are subject to rewiring every time step. Agents can choose costly cooperation or costless defection.

An intermediate $r$ induces high levels of cooperation, thus increasing average wealth and decreasing the gini coefficient (C-C benefits both ends of the dyad by the same amount). Intuitively, this is because when edges are rarely subject to reevaluation, the threat of punishment via edge destruction is not credible, and when they are constantly subject, the promise of long-term collaboration is not credible.
